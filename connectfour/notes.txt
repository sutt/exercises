Refactor out board: all that is needed is board.height, board.width. Could be a named tuple.
                    but this is tricky as cf:main needs to init height/width which is then passed in
                    each time Play() is init'data

                    one way to do this is MetaPlay class which has height, width, num_players, FOUR, etc
                    now  Play() -> ConsturctorPlay()

Build a Tutorial: --tutorial_basic_gameplay = {noisy_log_strat = True, --runs = 1, etc...}
                  --tutorial_basic_stats = { --runs =300 --analytics --readfile etc...}


VERY IMPORTANT 
 - for 1-time declared list/nested-lists 
 - used in multiple re-instantiated classes inside a loop
    
    import copy
    byval_list = copy.deepcopy(list)


Build a Log-Class and pass it into significant funtions:

     Game.method(log = instanceLog)

     Use __init__ to build a dict of the data you want to track through the programs
     append an inner-loop's worth of data to a running tally in the outer-loop, then reset this data inner data
